# Malware Remediation Playbook

**Synopsis:** This playbook is for responding to confirmed malware infections, unauthorized software, and suspicious command executions that could indicate a system compromise. This includes unauthorized access to sensitive files like `/etc/shadow`.

## Section 1: Initial Triage

When a malware alert is confirmed, the analyst must immediately assess the scope and severity of the incident.

## Section 2: Containment Procedure

**2.1 Quarantine Host:** The first and most critical step is to quarantine the infected host from the network. This prevents the malware from spreading to other systems (lateral movement). Use the endpoint security platform to isolate the machine.

**2.2 Block C2 Communication:** If the malware is communicating with a Command and Control (C2) server, block the C2 IP address at the network firewall immediately.

## Section 3: Eradication

Once the host is contained, proceed with removing the malicious software according to standard operating procedures.
